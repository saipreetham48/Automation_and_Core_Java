# Automation Framework

This is a Java-based test automation framework that supports both **UI automation** (using Selenium) and **API automation** (using RestAssured). The framework is built using **Cucumber** for BDD-style test cases, **TestNG** for test execution and reporting, and uses **Core Java** principles to maintain scalability and modularity.
